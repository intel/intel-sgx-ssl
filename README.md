Intel® Software Guard Extensions SSL (SGX SSL)
================================================

Introduction
------------
The Intel® Software Guard Extensions SSL (Intel® SGX SSL) cryptographic library is intended to provide cryptographic services for Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclave applications.
The Intel® SGX SSL cryptographic library is based on the underlying OpenSSL* Open Source project, providing a full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

This branch supports the OpenSSL 3.0 series, but works in 1.1.1 compatible mode.

Building the Intel® SGX SSL package
-----------------------------------

## Windows

### Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
- Perl
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- Intel(R) SGX Windows latest release, including SDK, PSW, and driver

 (Note: Perl, NASM need to be included in machine's PATH variable)

### Building

To build the Intel® SGX SSL package in Windows OS:
1. Download the OpenSSL package into the openssl_source/ directory. (tar.gz package, e.g. openssl-3.0.*.tar.gz)
2. Download and install the latest SGX SDK from [Intel Developer Zone](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx-sdk/download). You can find the installation guide in the same website.
3. Change the directory to the SGXSSL path and enter the following command:
```
build_all.cmd <OPENSSL_VERSION> [default == openssl-3.0.17]
```
This builds the Intel® SGX SSL libraries (libsgx_tsgxssl.lib, libsgx_usgxssl.lib, libsgx_tsgxssl_crypto.lib) that can be found in package/lib/{Win32|X64}/{debug|release}/. The version with CVE-2020-0551 mitigation enabled can be found in package/lib/X64/{CVE-2020-0551-CF-Release|CVE-2020-0551-Load-Release}/.

## Linux

### Prerequisites
- Perl
- Toolchain with mitigation (refer to [SGX Linux README](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/blob/master/README.md))
- Intel(R) SGX Linux latest release, including SDK and PSW.

### Building

To build the Intel® SGX SSL package in Linux OS:
1. Download the OpenSSL 3.0.* package into openssl_source/ directory. (tar.gz package, e.g. openssl-3.0.*.tar.gz)
2. Download and install the latest SGX SDK from [01.org](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/). You can find the installation guide in the same website.
3. Source SGX SDK's environment variables.
4. Change into the Linux/ directory and run:
```
make all test
```
This builds and tests the Intel® SGX SSL libraries (libsgx_tsgxssl.a, libsgx_usgxssl.a, libsgx_tsgxssl_crypto.a), which can be found in package/lib64/. The Intel® SGX SSL trusted libraries (libsgx_tsgxssl.lib,  libsgx_tsgxssl_crypto.lib) with CVE-2020-0551 mitigation enabled can be found in package/lib64/{cve_2020_0551_cf|cve_2020_0551_load}/.

### Available `make` flags:
- DEBUG={1,0}: Libraries build mode, with debug symbols or without. Default ``0``.
- NO_THREADS={1,0}: Enable ``no-threads`` in the OpenSSL's build configuration options. Default ``0``.
- SGX_MODE={HW,SIM}: User can take ``SIM`` to run the unit test on non-SGX platform if necessary. Default ``HW``. 
- DESTDIR=\<PATH\>: Directory realpath to install Intel® SGX SSL libraries in. Default ``/opt/intel/sgxssl/``. 
- VERBOSE={1,0}: Makefile verbose mode. Print compilation commands before executing it. Default ``0``.
- OSSL3ONLY={1,0}: Use only OpenSSL 3.x APIs, and legacy functions will not be valid. Default ``0``.
- FIPS={1,0}: Use the OpenSSL FIPS provider as an experimental feature. Default ``0``.

To install Intel® SGX SSL libraries in Linux OS, run:
```
make all test
sudo make install
```

## Note for Version 3.*
----------------------
To use the trusted cryptography library with SGX SSL/OpenSSL 3.*, especially for the multithreaded enclaves, you may need to increase the enclave heap size adjusting the enclave signing configuration XML file:
```
...
<HeapMaxSize>...</HeapMaxSize>
...
```

## OpenSSL FIPS Provider
----------------------

As an experimental feature, the SGX SDK supports building the SGX SSL library using the OpenSSL FIPS provider, instead of the default provider. Note: This feature is only supported on Linux and OpenSSL 3.1.6. You must download two separate OpenSSL packages: one from the OpenSSL 3.0 series and one for OpenSSL 3.1.6.
To build and install the Intel® SGX SSL package and the OpenSSL FIPS provider run:

```
make all FIPS=1
sudo make install
```

You may build and run one or both test programs that utilize the FIPS provider. The `FIPS=1` option must be specified; otherwise, a linker error will occur.
```
make test FIPS=1
make fips_test FIPS=1
```
